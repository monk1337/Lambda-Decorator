What are lambda Functions ?

Lambda functions  is a function that is defined without a name , That's why it also know as Anonymous function. Lambda function is very important topic in Functional programming , Indeed Every Functional programming use Lambda Functions. Lambda Functions are based on Lambda calculas.

A bit of lambda calculas :

How write function in Lambda caluclas :

Valid λ-calculus expressions can be defined inductively as follows:

- A variable x is a valid λ-term.
- If t is a valid λ-term and x is a variable, then λx. t is a valid λ-term.
- If t and s are both valid λ-terms, then t s is a valid λ-term. **

λx. x
In above expression λx is a function with a single parameter which is x and then [dot] after second "x" is expression.
